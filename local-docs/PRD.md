# üìå PRD: Task Functionality with Chatbot Refinement

## Overview

The **Task** feature enables users to submit simple task descriptions that are automatically refined by a chatbot based on the project‚Äôs tech stack. The goal is to elevate the input to the level of an experienced product manager, providing a structured and actionable output for development teams.

This feature uses the **OpenAI API** to refine task descriptions through a language learning model (LLM).

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Enable users to submit basic task descriptions.
- Automatically refine descriptions using an LLM.
- Return refined tasks in a structured JSON format.
- Store refinement suggestions and conversation history.
- Support iterative task improvement via user feedback.
- Allow saving of finalized tasks.
- Convert tasks into markdown, chunk content, and store as vector embeddings for future chatbot queries.

---

## üß± Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React Router 7 (Framework Mode)
- **Database:** SQLite
- **ORM:** Prisma ORM
- **LLM API:** OpenAI (for task refinement)
- **Vector Storage:** SQLite-compatible solution

---

## üì• User Input

Users provide:

- A simple task description (e.g., "create login form with authentication").

---

## ü§ñ Chatbot Processing

The system sends the task description along with the project stack context to **OpenAI**, instructing the model to respond like a seasoned product manager.

### Example Prompt:

```
This project uses React Router 7 (framework mode), SQLite, and Prisma ORM.
Please refine the following task description and return a JSON object with:
title, description, steps, estimated_time, acceptance_criteria, suggested_tests, and implementation_suggestion.

Original description: "create login form with authentication"
```

---

## üì§ Expected JSON Output

```json
{
  "title": "Secure Login Form with Authentication",
  "description": "Implement a modern login form with field validation, session-based authentication, and real-time error feedback.",
  "estimated_time": "2 days",
  "steps": [
    "Create a form component using React",
    "Add field validation using a suitable library",
    "Connect backend for user authentication",
    "Persist sessions using SQLite",
    "Test full login and logout flow"
  ],
  "suggested_tests": [
    "it('should render login form correctly')",
    "it('should validate input fields')",
    "it('should authenticate valid credentials')",
    "it('should prevent access with invalid credentials')"
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Login form displays properly with required fields",
    "Invalid input is correctly flagged",
    "Valid users can log in and maintain a session",
    "Users are redirected upon login and logout"
  ],
  "implementation_suggestion": "Use React Hook Form for input validation, Prisma ORM for managing user data, and configure protected routes using React Router 7."
}
```

## üí¨ Chat History

- All chatbot conversations will be stored in a **`chats`** table.
- Users can revisit and continue previous chats.
- Each conversation will be timestamped and linked to both the user and the associated task.

## üß† Vector-Based AI Functionality (Future)

- All finalized tasks will be stored as vector embeddings.
- Future chatbot capabilities will include semantic search such as:
  - "Which tasks involve authentication?"
  - "List tasks that deal with form validation."

---

## üñºÔ∏è User Interface

- Chatbot interface for input submission and refinement.
- Readable UI component displaying the refined JSON result.
- "Save Task" button to store the refined task.

---

## üìà Success Metrics

- Average time to finalize a task.
- Number of tasks stored with vector embeddings.
- User engagement with past suggestions and chat history.
